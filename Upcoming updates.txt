Upcoming Updates:

1- Implement a Publisher/Subscriber pattern for payment operations.
-When a payment is processed, the system will publish an event that subscribers can handle for actions such as notifications, logging, or additional business workflows.

2- Enhance password security by storing user passwords in the database using hashing with salting.
-PBKDF2 (or other secure algorithms such as bcrypt or Argon2) will be used to protect credentials and improve authentication security.

3- Use Stored Procedures Instead of Dynamic SQL:
-Replace all inline SQL queries with stored procedures for all People-related operations.
This will improve database security, enforce consistent structure, and enhance maintainability.

4- Database Triggers like People Table:
-Implement soft delete and logging.
-Add an INSTEAD OF DELETE trigger to perform soft deletes instead of physical deletions.
-Add AFTER INSERT and AFTER UPDATE triggers to capture changes.
-Create dedicated log tables.
-Log records will include UserID and a timestamp to support auditing and traceability.
